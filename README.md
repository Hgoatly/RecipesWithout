# Recipes Without

## A customisable online resource for recipes without gluten, dairy or eggs

## Site Owner Goals:

Recipes Without is a recipe site that is designed to be a customisable online resource for those looking to 
prepare meals free from gluten, dairy or eggs. It is primarily intened for those suffering from allergies or intolerances. 
However the recipies can be enjoyed by anyone. 

It has two main objectives: 

1. To allow site users to find recipies without allergens.
2. To allow site users to store and manage their favourite recipies in an easily accessable format.

## Business Owner Goals:

- The site has one main goal, which is to collect recipies in order to publish them in a physical book at a later date.

- The secondary goal is for the site to be monetised through the advertising of appropriate allergen-free ingredients
by appropriate companies. This will be implemented at a later date. 

## UX:

### User Stories:

1. I have an allergy or intolerance to gluten, dairy or eggs and would like to find some appropriate recipes so that 
I can prepare myself a tasty meal that is also safe for me to eat.
2. I have a friend or relative who has an allergy or intolerance to gluten, dairy or eggs, and I would like to find some 
recipes so that I can safely cook them a tasty meal. 
3. I am a restaurant or cafe owner, and I would like to find inspiration for dishes that I can add to my menu that would
be suitable for diners with intolerances to gluten, dairy or eggs.
4. I am any of the above users, and I would like to be able to upload, edit and delete my own recipes, without other 
users being able to tamper with them.
